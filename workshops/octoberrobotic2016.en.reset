From Reset we want to welcome you to the course 2016/2017 on which we have a lot of things to offer you.

Because of the success of the last year's workshops, we want to anounce we are going to repeat these workshops  the upcoming 5, 7 and 14 of october.

On these workshops you will  learn to program in Arduino, to design basic circuits to control with Arduino and to build your own programmable robotic arm.

? These workshops are totally free!!.

If you are tired of all the theory learned that you never use in the real life and you want to do a really satisfactory activity where you are going to design and build useful devices that actually works, <strong>this is your opportunity!</strong>

We are going to give you all the needed material except a laptop (It is only needed one for each three people)
