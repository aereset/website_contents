----

While building any robot we have to take into account that motors and any other kind of actuators that require power can not be powered directly through the microcontroller. That's why power amplifiers are needed. They allow you to provide the necessary voltage and current through the motor controller.

In Cybertech, we are using the Cybertech Motor Control power amplifier. Reset will teach you how it works, its components and how to build it.
